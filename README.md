## CryptoPoops NFT Collection Smart Contract

Welcome to the CryptoPoops smart contract repository! This contract provides a basic implementation of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Flow blockchain using the Cadence programming language. The contract offers various features for minting NFTs, managing collections, and interacting with NFTs within the collection.

## Overview

The CryptoPoops contract comprises three main components:

1. **NFT Resource**: Defines unique non-fungible tokens with distinct properties such as name, favorite food, and lucky number.

2. **Collection Resource**: Acts as a manager for handling NFT ownership within a collection. It provides functions for depositing, withdrawing, and retrieving NFTs.

3. **MintingFacility Resource**: Offers functionalities for generating new NFTs and managing minting operations.

## Usage

### 1. Minting NFTs

Use the MintingFacility resource to create new NFTs with specified properties.

### 2. Creating Collections

Establish an empty NFT collection using the `createEmptyNFTCollection` function.

### 3. Depositing and Withdrawing

Engage with the NFT collection by depositing and withdrawing NFTs using appropriate functions.

### 4. Public Interface

Access the public interface to interact with functions for NFT deposit, retrieval, and borrowing.
